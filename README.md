This is a repo of all the miscellaneous Python programs that I write for various purposes. I figured out it would be better to put these in a repo so that people may learn something, instead of the programs just getting mercilessly deleted away.

Let's play some Code Golf. See if you can try and make the programs using lesser code. Tell me if you can.

Feel free to explore and ask questions. Corrections are always welcome.

Enjoy!
