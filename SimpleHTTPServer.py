''' 
This is not actually a Python program
But it is, undeniably, an amazing piece of code
N.B. Python2 must be installed on the machine

At the terminal, cd into the folder you want
run the following command

python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

then, it will set up a simple HTTP server on port 8080
sharing the contents of the folder

Explanation of the code -

This command executes Python2
and imports the embedded Python2 module SimpleHTTPServer
which runs an HTTP server on port 8080 of the machine
on the directory this code is executed in

Simple way to quickly send some files :D
